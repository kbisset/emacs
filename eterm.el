;;; eterm --- Emacs alternative to xterm shells
;;; Version 1.0, July 2002, by Luke Gorrie <luke@bluetail.com>
;;; Written and tested in GNU Emacs 21

;; Emacs frames with shells, as an alternative to xterms.
;;
;; The main command `eterm' brings up a new frame with a new shell in
;; it, and closing the window kills the shell. `eterm-select' can get
;; you back to the shell after you go a'wanderin' to other buffers in
;; your eterm.
;;
;; If you have gnuserv installed, you might like to combine this with
;; an "eterm" shell script like:
;;
;;     #!/bin/sh
;;     gnudoit '(eterm)' >/dev/null
;;
;; And perhaps a Sawfish command:
;; 
;;     (defun eterm ()
;;       (interactive)
;;       (system "gnudoit '(eterm)' >/dev/null &"))

automatically killed when the frame closes.

If you visit some other buffers from your eterm, you can get back to
the shell with `eterm-select'."
